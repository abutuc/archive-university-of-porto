In this course one of the projects was to contribute to an open-source project. The one me and my team chose was forem, and I contributed with the following pull requests:

- [Removal of Default Alt Image Description](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/21733)
- [Removed Local Storage After Logout](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/21776)
