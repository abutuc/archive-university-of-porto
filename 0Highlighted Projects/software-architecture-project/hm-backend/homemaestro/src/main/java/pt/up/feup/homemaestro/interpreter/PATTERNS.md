# Design Patterns Applied in the Interpreter Implementation

This document explains the design patterns used in the Interpreter-based implementation for parsing and evaluating
conditional expressions involving device states. We apply several GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns as well as modern
patterns to achieve a clean, flexible, and maintainable solution.

## 1. Interpreter Pattern

### Problem:

You need to evaluate conditional expressions in a custom language. The expressions involve logical conditions (`AND`,
`OR`), device states (e.g., `sensor1 on`), and actions (e.g., `light1 on`). Parsing and interpreting such expressions
can become complex, especially when dealing with nested conditions.

### Pattern:

The **Interpreter Pattern** is used to define a grammar for a language and provide a way to interpret its syntax. In
this case, the language is defined by device conditions and actions, and each expression is modeled as a class that
implements the `interpret()` method.

### Consequences:

#### Advantages:

- **Modularity**: Each type of expression (`AndExpression`, `OrExpression`, `DeviceStateExpression`) can be developed
  independently, making the codebase more modular.
- **Extensibility**: New types of expressions can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the *
  *Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**.
- **Clarity**: The grammar and interpretation logic are encapsulated in individual expression classes, which makes the
  code easier to follow and maintain.

#### Disadvantages:

- **Complexity**: As the language grows more complex, the number of expression classes increases, which could lead to a
  more complicated class hierarchy.
- **Performance**: Evaluating a large number of expressions, especially with deeply nested conditions, could incur
  performance costs due to the recursive nature of the interpretation.

## 2. Composite Pattern

### Problem:

You want to combine multiple expressions (e.g., `sensor1 on AND sensor2 off`) into a single composite structure so that
you can evaluate them as a whole. This helps handle complex conditional logic like
`if (sensor1 on AND (sensor2 off OR door6 open))`.

### Pattern:

The **Composite Pattern** allows you to compose complex expressions from simpler ones. In this case, logical operators
like `AND` and `OR` act as composite expressions that combine multiple `Expression` objects into a larger structure.

### Consequences:

#### Advantages:

- **Simplifies Complex Structures**: By using `AndExpression` and `OrExpression` as composite nodes, complex conditions
  can be represented as trees, making the logic easier to process.
- **Open for Extension**: New logical operators can be added without altering existing code, making the system
  extensible (supporting **OCP**).

#### Disadvantages:

- **Increased Class Hierarchy**: Adding new expressions for each type of logical operation (e.g., `NotExpression`) can
  increase the complexity of the class hierarchy.
- **Memory Usage**: A larger number of objects may be created when building composite structures, which could increase
  memory usage for large expressions.

## 3. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

### Problem:

You need to manage multiple parsing responsibilities in the `Parser` class. The parser should handle different parts of
the expression (conditions, actions, logical operators) while maintaining clarity and flexibility.

### Pattern:

The **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** allows you to break the parsing process into a sequence of responsibilities.
Each method (e.g., `parseCondition()`, `parseLogicalExpression()`, `parseDeviceAction()`) is responsible for a specific
part of the expression and delegates responsibility to the next method when appropriate.

### Consequences:

#### Advantages:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each part of the parsing process is handled in its own method, ensuring that the parser
  class remains focused and easy to maintain.
- **Flexibility**: The parsing chain can easily be extended to handle new rules or formats without modifying the
  existing code (supports **OCP**).

#### Disadvantages:

- **Complexity**: The flow of responsibility through a chain of methods might be harder to follow, especially for
  complex parsing logic.
- **Increased Method Count**: Each responsibility must be implemented in a separate method, potentially increasing the
  number of methods in the parser class.

## 4. Null Object Pattern

### Problem:

You need to handle cases where an expression is not valid or cannot be evaluated. In such cases, returning `null` or
throwing exceptions might introduce complexity and additional checks throughout the code.

### Pattern:

The **Null Object Pattern** provides a default object (e.g., `NullExpression`) that represents a no-op operation. This
object behaves like other expressions but does nothing, simplifying the code by removing the need for `null` checks.

### Consequences:

#### Advantages:

- **Simplified Control Flow**: By using `NullExpression`, you can avoid the need for explicit `null` checks in the
  interpreter and parser, making the control flow cleaner.
- **Reduced Error-Prone Code**: Avoids potential `NullPointerException` issues, as the `NullExpression` is a valid
  object and can be safely used in the expression tree.

#### Disadvantages:

- **Excess Object Creation**: Even though `NullExpression` does nothing, it still requires an instance, which could add
  unnecessary object creation.
- **Overhead in Understanding**: Developers might be initially confused by the presence of `NullExpression` as it does
  nothing. Proper documentation is needed to make this pattern clear.

## 5. Context Pattern

### Problem:

You need a central place to store and manage the state of devices (e.g., `sensor1 on`, `light1 off`). This state needs
to be accessed by multiple expressions during interpretation.

### Pattern:

The **Context Pattern** provides a central storage system (in this case, the `Context` class) to hold device states.
Expressions refer to this context to check and update device states while evaluating conditions and performing actions.

### Consequences:

#### Advantages:

- **Centralized State Management**: The `Context` class provides a single place to manage device states, making it
  easier to update and query states during interpretation.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By decoupling device state management from the expression logic, the system is more
  modular and easier to maintain.

#### Disadvantages:

- **Tight Coupling to Context**: Expressions rely on the `Context` to evaluate conditions, which can create tight
  coupling between the expressions and the state management.
- **Scalability**: As the number of devices and states grows, the `Context` class could become a bottleneck or a
  performance concern, depending on how the state is managed.

## Conclusion

The design patterns applied in this implementation help address various challenges related to parsing and evaluating
conditional expressions. By using well-established patterns like Interpreter, Composite, Chain of Responsibility, Null
Object, and Context, the system achieves a high degree of flexibility, modularity, and maintainability. However, as with
any pattern, there are trade-offs in complexity, performance, and potential overhead, which should be carefully
considered when extending or optimizing the system.
